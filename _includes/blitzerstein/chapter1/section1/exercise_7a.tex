\begin{exercise}{7a}
Two chess players, A and B, are going to play 7 games. Each game has three possible
outcomes: a win for A (which is a loss for B), a draw (tie), and a loss for A (which is
a win for B). A win is worth 1 point, a draw is worth 0.5 points, and a loss is worth 0
points.

\vspace{1em}
How many possible outcomes for the individual games are there, such that overall
player A ends up with 3 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses?
\end{exercise}


\begin{proof}
    We can mark the win of player A with "W", the draw with "D" and the loss with "L". Then
    the results of the games can be expressed as a sequence of Ws, Ds and Ls. Note that this problem
    is entirely symmetric from the point of view of player B, switching wins with loses.

    In order for A to end up with 3 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses, in the game result sequence we need to have
    3 Ws, 2 Ds and 2 Ls. So the number of outcomes we are interested in is the number of permutations of the string
    WWWDDLL. There are 7 letters, so 7! possible permutations. And we need to remove from the computation the 3!
    permutations of the 3 Ws and 2! permutations of the Ds and Ls, since they do not change the string. Therefore,
    there are $\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 210$ possible outcomes.
\end{proof}
