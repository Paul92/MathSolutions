  \begin{exercise}{1}
  How many ways are there to permute the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI?
  \end{exercise}

  \begin{proof}
  The word MISSISSIPPI has 11 letters, with 4 Ps, 4 Is, 2 Ps and 1 M. A 11 letter word has 11! permutations, out of which we need to remove 4!4!2! permutations due to repeated letters. Hence, there are in total $\frac{11!}{4!4!2!} =
  5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \cdot 11 = 34650$.
  \end{proof}
