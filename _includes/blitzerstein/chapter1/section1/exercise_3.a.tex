\begin{exercise}{3.a}
Fred is planning to go out to dinner each night of a certain week, Monday through Friday, with each dinner being at one of his ten favorite restaurants.

\vspace{1em}
How many possibilities are there for Fredâ€™s schedule of dinners for that Monday through Friday, if Fred is not willing to eat at the same restaurant more than once?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    There are 5 days when Fred wants to eat out. In the first day, he can choose any of the 10 restaurants. In the second day, he can choose any of the remaining 9 restaurants. Continuing this, in the fifth and last day, Fred has 6 restaurants which he can choose such that there is no repetition. Therefore, there are $10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 = 30240$ possible schedules.
\end{proof}
