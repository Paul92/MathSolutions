\begin{exercise}{2.a}
    How many 7-digit phone numbers are possible, assuming that the first digit canâ€™t be a 0 or a 1?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    There are 8 ways of choosing the first digit and 10 ways of choosing each of the remaining six digits. Therefore, there are $8 \cdot 10^6$ possible 7-digit phone numbers.
\end{proof}
