\begin{exercise}{8.b}
How many ways are there to split a dozen people into 3 teams, where each team has 4 people?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    As before, we first choose 4 people out of 12 and then 4 people out of the remaining 8.
We then have to account for the team symmetries. With three teams, the groups of four people can be assigned in 6 ways. Therefore, there are ${12 \choose 4} \cdot {12 \choose 4} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 5775$ possible assignments. Quite a bit less than in the previous problem, due to the larger symmetry.

    
\end{proof}
