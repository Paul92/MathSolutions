\begin{exercise}{5.b}
Count how many games in total are played, by adding up the numbers of games
played in each round.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
        On level $i$ there are $2^{n-i+1}$ players involved, playing $2^{n-i}$ games. Therefore, the number of games played is $\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{n-i} = 2^n-1$.
\end{proof}
