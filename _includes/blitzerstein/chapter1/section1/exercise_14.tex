\begin{exercise}{14}
    You are ordering two pizzas. A pizza can be small, medium, large, or extra large, with
any combination of 8 possible toppings (getting no toppings is allowed, as is getting all
8). How many possibilities are there for your two pizzas?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Each of the possible topping can be present or not. This means that there are 2 options for each topping, and therefore
    there are $2^8$ combinations of toppings, including the "no topping" option.

    One pizza can have one of four sizes, so there are $2^2 \cdot 2^8 = 2^{10}$ versions of a pizza. And there are two pizzas, so there are $2 \cdot 2^{10} = 2^{11} = 2048$ possibilities for the order.
\end{proof}
