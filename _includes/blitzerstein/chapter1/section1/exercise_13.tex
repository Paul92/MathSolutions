\begin{exercise}{13}
    A certain casino uses 10 standard decks of cards mixed together into one big deck, which
we will call a superdeck. Thus, the superdeck has 52 Â· 10 = 520 cards, with 10 copies
of each card. How many different 10-card hands can be dealt from the superdeck? The
order of the cards does not matter, nor does it matter which of the original 10 decks
the cards came from. Express your answer as a binomial coefficient.
Hint: Bose-Einstein.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Note that since the hand has 10 cards, the same as the card multiplicity, the problem is equivalent to asking
    how many samples of 10 can be extracted from a deck of 52 cards, with repetition.

    Since each card has equal probability, we can simply apply the Bose-Einstein result to obtain ${52+10-1 \choose 10} = {61 \choose 10}$ possible hands.
\end{proof}
