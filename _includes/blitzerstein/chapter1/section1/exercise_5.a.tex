\begin{exercise}{5.a}
A knock-out tournament is being held with $2^n$ tennis players. This means that for each
round, the winners move on to the next round and the losers are eliminated, until only
one person remains. For example, if initially there are $2^4 = 16$ players, then there are
8 games in the first round, then the 8 winners move on to round 2, then the 4 winners
move on to round 3, then the 2 winners move on to round 4, the winner of which is
declared the winner of the tournament. (There are various systems for determining who
plays whom within a round, but these do not matter for this problem.)

How many rounds are there?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    After each round, half of the players proceed to the next round. Therefore, if the first round has $2^n$ players, the second round will have $\frac{2^n}{2}=2^{n-1}$, the third round will have $2^{n-2}$, and so on until a single player is left. Hence, there are $n$ rounds.
\end{proof}
