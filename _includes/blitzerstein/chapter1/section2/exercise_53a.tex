\begin{exercise}{53a}
Fred needs to choose a password for a certain website. Assume that he will choose an 8-character password, and that the legal characters are the lowercase letters a,b,c,...,z, the uppercase letters A,B,C,...,Z and the numbers 0,1,...,9.

How many possibilities are there if he is required to have at least one lowercase letter?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    There are $26+26+10=62$ available symbols, which means there are $62^8$ distinct 8-character passwords.

    In order to guarantee that the password contains at least one lowercase letter, we can subtract the passwords which do not contain any lowercase letters. These are passwords formed from the $26+10=36$ remaining characters, in a number of $36^8$. Hence, there are $62^8-36^8 = 215518995677440 \approx 2.16 \cdot 10^{14}$ 8-character passwords with at least one lowercase letter.
\end{proof}
