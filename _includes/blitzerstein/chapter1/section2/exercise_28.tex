\begin{exercise}{28}
    With definitions as in the previous problem, find the probability that a random $n$-letter
word is a palindrome for $n = 7$ and for $n = 8$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    In order for a seven letter word to be a palindrome, the last three letters must be the same as the first three letters. This means that there are only four independent choices for the first four letters, leading to a probability of $\frac{26^4}{27^7} = \frac{1}{26^3}$.

    In the case of eight letter words, the last four letters must be identical to the first four letters, so there are also four independent choices to be made, but the total number of eight letter words is higher. The probability of an eight letter word to be a palindrome is $\frac{26^4}{26^8} = \frac{1}{26^4}$.
    
\end{proof}
