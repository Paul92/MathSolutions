\begin{exercise}{24b}
Find the probability that at least one person will get chosen more than once.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    As in the solution for the birthday problem, we approach this task by solving its complement: we look for the probability that no person will be chosen twice. This quantity is $P(A) = \prod_{k=0}^{999} \frac{10^6-k}{10^6} \approx 0.61$ and therefore the probability that at least one problem will be chosen more than once is $1-P(A)\approx 0.39$
\end{proof}
