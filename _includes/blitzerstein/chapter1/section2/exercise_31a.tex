\begin{exercise}{31a}
A jar contains r red balls and g green balls, where r and g are fixed positive integers.
A ball is drawn from the jar randomly (with all possibilities equally likely), and then a
second ball is drawn randomly.

Explain intuitively why the probability of the second ball being green is the same
as the probability of the first ball being green.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    The process of extracting one ball and then a second ball is the same as extracting the two balls at once, and then randomly labelling one as the first one and the other as the second one. Therefore, the probability that they are green is identical.
\end{proof}
