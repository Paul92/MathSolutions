\begin{exercise}{24}
A certain family has 6 children, consisting of 3 boys and 3 girls. Assuming that all
birth orders are equally likely, what is the probability that the 3 eldest children are the
3 girls?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Assuming that the kids have distinct identities, the six kids can be born in $6! = 720$ possible orders. There are $3!$ orders of the three eldest children and $3!$ orders of the remaining children, leading to a probability of $\frac{3!3!}{6!} = \frac{1}{20}$ that the eldest three children are girls.
\end{proof}
