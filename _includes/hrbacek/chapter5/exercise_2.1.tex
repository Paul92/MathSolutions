\subsection*{2.1} Prove that the set of all finite sets of reals has cardinality $2^{\aleph_0}$.

\begin{proof}
There is an injective map between the finite sets of reals and the infinite sequences of real numbers. Let $X$ be a finite set of reals with $n$ elements. This implies that there is a an injection to the natural numbers, and hence we can enumerate them. Moreover, since the set is finite, there is a unique permutation of $X$ with the elements in ascending order. Therefore, we can denote the elements of $X$ by $x_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ with $x_i < x_j$ if and only if $i < j$. This defines the unique infinite sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, 0, \dots)$. By this construction, we have an injective map between the finite subsets of $R$ and the infinite sequences with real elements. But the latter are equivalent to the set of functions from $N$ to $R$, i.e. $R^N$, which is known to have cardinality $2^{\aleph_0}$.
