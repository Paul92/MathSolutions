\subsection*{2.6} The cardinality of the set of all discontinuous functions is $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$

\begin{proof}
    The number of discontinuous functions can be computed as the total number of functions, except the continuous ones. I.e., $2^{2^{\aleph_0}} - 2^{\aleph_0} = 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$.
\end{proof}
