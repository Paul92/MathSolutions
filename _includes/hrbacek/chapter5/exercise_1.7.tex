\subsection*{1.7} Use Cantor's Theorem to show that the "set of all sets" does not exist.

\begin{proof}
Cantor's theorem states that $|X| < |P(X)|$ for all sets $X$. Assume to the contrary that $S$ is the set of all sets. Then, we can construct $|P(S)|$ and, by Cantor's Theorem, have that $|S| < |P(S)|$. But since $S$ is the set of all sets, $P(S) \subset S$ and thus $|P(S)| \leq |S|$. It follows that $|S| < |P(S)| \leq |S|$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
