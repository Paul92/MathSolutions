\subsection*{2.4} For every $n \in \mathbb{N}, n\neq 0$ there is a unique $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n = k+1$.

\begin{proof}
The successor function is, as shown in the previous exercise, a bijective function from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{N} - \{0\}$. Hence, it has a bijective inverse and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
