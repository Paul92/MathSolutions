\subsection*{2.8} If $X$ is a nonempty set of ordinals, $\bigcap X$ is an ordinal. Moreover, $\bigcap X$ is the least element of $X$.

\begin{proof}
    Pick $\alpha \in \bigcap X$. Then, $\alpha \in \beta$ for all $\beta \in X$, and hence $\alpha \subset \beta$ for all $\beta \in X$. It follows that $\alpha \subset \bigcap X$ and hence $\bigcap X$ is transitive. Since $\bigcap X \in \beta$ for all ordinals $\beta \in X$, it follows that $\bigcap X$ is a subset of well-ordered sets and hence itself is well ordered with respect to $\in$. It follows that $\bigcap X$ is an ordinal number.
    
    Since $\bigcap X \subseteq \beta$ for all $\beta \in X$, it follows that $\bigcap X < \beta$ for all $\beta \in X$ and hence $\bigcap X$ is the least element of $X$.
