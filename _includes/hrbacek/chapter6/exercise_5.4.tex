\subsection*{5.4} For every ordinal $\alpha$, there is a unique limit ordinal $\beta$ and a unique natural $n$ such that $\alpha = \beta + n$.

\begin{proof}
    Let $\beta = \sup\{\gamma \leq \alpha | \gamma~is~limit\}$. By construction, $\alpha \geq \beta$. By lemma 5.5 there is a unique ordinal $\theta$ such that $\alpha = \beta + \theta$. Remains to show that $\theta$ is a natural.

    Assume to the contrary that $\theta$ is not a natural. Then, $\theta \geq \omega$. But then either $\beta + \theta > \alpha$ or $\beta \leq \sup\{\gamma \leq \alpha | \gamma~is~limit\}$, both cases being a contradiction. It follows that $\theta$ is indeed natural.
\end{proof}
