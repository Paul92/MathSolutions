\subsection*{1.8} The sets $W = N \times \{0, 1\}$ and $W' = \{0, 1\} \times N$, ordered lexicographically, are nonisomorphic well-ordered sets. (See the remark following Theorem 4.7 in Chapter 4.)

\begin{proof}
    In the set $W$, any element $(n,m)$ has finitely many predecessors, while in $W'$, the elements of the form $(n,1)$ have infinitely many predecessors and hence the sets are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}
