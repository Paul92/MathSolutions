\subsection*{2.1} If $S = \{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$ a set of disjoint sets, then $|\bigcup S| = \sum |X_i|$

\begin{proof}
We are going to prove this by induction over $n$.

For $n = 2$, the result is proven in the textbook. Assume now that the result holds for any $n$, and consider $n+1$.

$$S = \{X_1, \dots, X_n, X_{n+1}\} =  \{X_1, \dots, X_n\} \cup \{X_{n+1}\} = \bigcup_{i=1}^n X_i \cup  \{X_{n+1}\}$$

But then

$$|S| = | \bigcup_{i=1}^n X_i \cup  \{X_{n+1}\}| = | \bigcup_{i=1}^n X_i| + |  \{X_{n+1}\}| = \sum_{i=1}^n |X_i| + |X_{n+1}| = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} |X_i|$$

and the conclusion follows.

\end{proof}
