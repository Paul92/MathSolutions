\subsection*{5.5} Let $D$ be dense in $(P,<)$ and $E$ be dense in $(D, <)$. Show that $E$ is dense in $(P, <)$.

\begin{proof}
Let $a,z \in P$ be some arbitrarily chosen points with $a < z$. Since $D$ is dense in $P$, there is some $d \in D \subseteq P$ such that $a < d < z$. But since $a < d$ as elements of $P$, there is some $c \in D$ such that $a < c < d$. It follows that $a < c < d < z$, with $a,c,d,z \in P$ and $c,d \in D \subseteq P$. Since $E$ is dense in $P$, it follows that there is some $e \in E \subseteq D \subseteq P$ such that $c < e < d$. And hence we have $a < c < e < d < z$ as elements of $P$. It follows that $a < e < z$. Since $a,z$ have been arbitrarily chosen elements of $P$ and we found some element of $E$ in between them, $E$ is dense in $P$.
