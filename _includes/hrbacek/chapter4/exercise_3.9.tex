\subsection*{3.9} 

For every $s = (s_0, \dots, s_{n-1}) \in Seq(\mathbb{N} - \{0\})$, let $f(s) = p_0^{s_0}\dots p_{n-1}^{s_{n-1}}$, 

where $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number. Show that $f$ is one-to-one and use this fact to give another proof of $|Seq(\mathbb{N})|=\aleph_0$.

\begin{proof}
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every number greater than 1 can be written as a unique product of prime factors. This implies that two different products of prime factors are different and hence $f$ is injective. Moreover, this theorem also implies that $f$ is surjective, since the exponents of the prime factors involved in the prime factor expansion cover all sequences on $\mathbb{N}$. The conclusion then follows.
\end{proof}
