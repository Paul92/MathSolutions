\subsection*{5.5} Give examples of a finite ordered set $(A, \leq)$ and a subset $B$ of $A$ such that

\begin{itemize}
    \item $B$ has no greatest element
    
    $$ A= \{1,2,3,d,e,f\}, B=\{3,d\}$$
    
    , with the natural number ordering and the lexicographic ordering between numbers and letters, respectively. 
    
    \item $B$ has no least element
    
    $$ A= \{1,2,3,d,e,f\}, B=\{3,d\}$$
    
    , with the natural number ordering and the lexicographic ordering between numbers and letters, respectively. 
    
    \item $B$ has no greatest element, but has a supremum
    
    $$ A= \{1,2,3,d,e,f,X\}, B=\{3,d\}$$
    
    , with the natural number ordering and the lexicographic ordering between numbers and letters, respectively. In addition, $\alpha \leq X$ for all $\alpha \in A$. $\alpha$ is the supremum for $B$.
    
    \item $B$ has no supremum
    $$ A= \{1,2,3,d,e,f\}, B=\{3,d\}$$
    
    , with the natural number ordering and the lexicographic ordering between numbers and letters, respectively. There is no element greater than all elements of $B$, since the elements of $B$ come from two different equivalence classes.
\end{itemize}
