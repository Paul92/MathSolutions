\subsection*{2.2} Show that $R^{-1}$ and $S \circ R$ exist.

\begin{proof}
Let $R$ be a relation. By definition, $R^{-1} = \{(b,a) | (a,b) \in R\}$. As shown before, the sets $dom~R$ and $ran~R$ exist. Now consider the set $X = ran~R \times dom~R$. By construction, for all $(a,b) \in R$ we have $(b,a) \in X$. Hence, $R^{-1} \subseteq X$.
\vspace{1em}
Now let $S$ and $R$ be two relations. Then, $dom~R$ and $ran~S$ exist and therefore the set $X = dom~R \times ran~S$ exists. Let $(a,b) \in S \circ R$. This means that there is some $y$ such that $(a,y) \in R$ and $(y,b) \in S$. It follows that $a \in dom~R$ and $b \in ran~S$. 
\end{proof}
