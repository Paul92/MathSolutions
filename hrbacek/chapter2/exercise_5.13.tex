\subsection*{5.13} If $h$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(Q, \prec)$ then $h^{-1}$ is an isomorphism between $(Q, \prec)$ and $(P, <)$.

\begin{proof}
If $h$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(Q, \prec)$, then $h$ is a bijective function and thus $h^{-1}$ exists and is bijective.

Pick some $a, b \in Q$. Then, $h^{-1}(a), h^{-1}(b) \in P$. Assume that $h^{-1}(a) < h^{-1}(b)$. Then, $a = h(h^{-1}(a)) < h(h^{-1}(b)) = b$ since $h$ is an isomorphism. Conversely, assume that $a < b$. This implies that $h(h^{-1}(a)) < h(h^{-1})(b)$ and since $h$ is an isomorphism, $h^{-1}(a) < h^{-1}(b)$. It then follows that $h^{-1}$ is an isomorphism.


\end{proof}
