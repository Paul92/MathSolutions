\subsection*{5.12} The identity function on $P$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(P, <)$.

\begin{proof}
The identity function is by construction bijective.

Pick some $a,b \in P$ such that $a < b$. Then, $id(a) = a < b = id(b)$ and, conversely, $id(a) < id(b)$ is equivalent to $a < b$. It follows that the identity function is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
