\subsection*{3.3} Use Theorem 3.6 to define

$$V_0 = \emptyset$$
$$V_{n+1} = P(V_n)$$
$$V_{\omega} = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} V_n$$

\begin{proof}
    Let $Q(X,Y)$ hold if and only if $Y$ is the power set of $X$. There is a unique power set for each set, and therefore we can define the power set operation $P(X)$. This implies that we can apply the recursion theorem (Theorem 3.6), using the initial element $V_0 = \emptyset$ and the $V_{n+1} = P(V_n)$.
\end{proof}
