\subsection*{1.2} $\omega + 1$ is not isomorphic to $\omega$ (in the well-ordering by $\in$)

\begin{proof}
    By definition, $\omega$ is the least transfinite number, and is equal to $N$. Hence, $\omega + 1 = N \cup \{N\}$. Note that, in the order on $\omega + 1$, the element $N$ is greater than or equal to any other element of $\omega+1$. It follows that $N \in \omega + 1$ is a greatest element. But the set $N$ does not have a greatest element, and hence $\omega+1$ and $\omega$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}
