\subsection*{1.7} Let $(W, <)$ be a well-ordered set, and let $a \notin W$. Extend $<$ to $W' = W \cup \{a\}$ by making $a$ greater than all $x \in W$. Then $W$ has smaller order type than $W'$.

\begin{proof}
    By construction $W \subset W'$. The identity function $i: W \rightarrow W'$ with $i(x) = x$ is a bijection from $W$ into the subset of $W'$ generated by $a$ and hence $W$ has a smaller order type. 
\end{proof}
