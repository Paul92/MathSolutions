\subsection*{1.8} Let $X$ be a set and let $f$ be a one to one mapping of $X$ into itself such that $f[X] \subset X$. Then $X$ is infinite.

\begin{proof}
Assume to the contrary that $X$ is finite and there is some $f: X \rightarrow X$ injective with $f[X] \subset X$. Then, $|X| \leq |f[X]| < |X|$, with the second inequality coming from the fact that $f[X] \subset X$ and $X$ is finite. But this is a contradiction and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
