\subsection*{1.2} Show that $\kappa^0=1$ and $\kappa^1=\kappa$ for all $\kappa$

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a set such that $|A| = \kappa$. Then, $\kappa^0 = |A^\emptyset|$ is the number of functions from the empty set to $A$. There is only one such function, the empty function, and hence $\kappa^0 = 1$.

$\kappa^1 = |A^{\{s\}}|$ is the set of functions from a singleton to $A$. There is a bijection $f:A \rightarrow A^{\{s\}}$, $f(x)$ being the function that maps $s$ to $x \in A$. Hence, there are exactly $|A| = \kappa$ functions from $\{s\}$ to $A$, and hence $\kappa^1 = \kappa$.
\end{proof}
