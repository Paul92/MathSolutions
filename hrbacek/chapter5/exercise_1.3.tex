\subsection*{1.3} Show that $1^{\kappa} = 1 $ for all $\kappa$ 

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be some set such that $|A| = \kappa$. Then, $1^\kappa = |\{s\}^\kappa|$ is the number of functions from $A$ to a singleton. There is only one such function: the constant function $f:A \rightarrow \{s\}$, $f(x) = s$.
\end{proof}
