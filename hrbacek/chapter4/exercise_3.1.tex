Let $|A_1| = |A_2|$, $|B_1| = |B_2|$. Prove

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset$, $B_1 \cap B_2 = \emptyset$, then $|A_1 \cup A_2| = |B_1 \cup B_2|$.
    
\begin{proof}
Two sets have equal cardinalities if there is a bijection between them. Hence, there is a bijection $f$ between $A_1$ and $A_2$ and there is a bijection $g$ between $B_1$ and $B_2$. We can then construct the function $h: A_1 \cup A_2 \rightarrow B_1 \cup B_2$, with $h(x) = f(x)$ if $x \in A_1$ and $h(x) = g(x)$ if $x \in A_2$. Since $A_1$ and $A_2$ are disjoint, as well as $B_1$ and $B_2$, and $f$ and $g$ are bijections, it follows that $h$ is a bijection and the result follows.

\end{proof}

\item $|A_1 \times A_2 | = |B_1 \times B_2|$. 

\begin{proof}
Let $h:A_1 \times A_2 \rightarrow B_1 \times B_2$, $h(x,y) = (f(x), g(y))$. Since $f,g$ are bijective, $h$ is bijective and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}

\item $|Seq(A_1)| = |Seq(A_2)|$

\begin{proof}
There is a bijection $f$ between $A_1$ and $A_2$, since they have the same cardinality. Then, for every $s \in Seq(A_1)$, we can construct a unique element in $A_2$, defined by $s_i = f(s_i)$. This is bijective, following from the bijectivity of $f$, and the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
    
\end{enumerate}
