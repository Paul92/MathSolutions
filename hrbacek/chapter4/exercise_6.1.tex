\subsection*{6.1} Use the diagonal argument to show that $N^N$ is uncountable.

\begin{proof}
$N^N$ is the set of functions from $N$ to $N$, which is the same as the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Assume that this set is countable. Then, we can form a sequence $(x_n)$ of its elements. We construct the sequence $(a_n)$, with $a_i = x_{ii}+1$, i.e. the i-th element in the sequence $(a_n)$ is the i-th element of the i-th sequence in $(x_n)$. By construction, $(a_n)$ is different from any element of $(x_n)$. This implies that $|N^N|>|N|$ and hence $N^N$ is uncountable.
\end{proof}
