\subsection*{6.3} Show that $|A| = |B|$ implies that $|P(A)| = |P(B)|$.

\begin{proof}
If $|A| = |B|$, then there is a bijection $f$ from $A$ to $B$. We can construct a function $g:P(A) \rightarrow P(B)$, which uniquely maps each subset of $A$ into a subset of $B$ by applying $f$ to each element. Since $f$ is bijective, $g$ is also bijective. It follows that $|P(A)| = |P(B)|$.
\end{proof}
