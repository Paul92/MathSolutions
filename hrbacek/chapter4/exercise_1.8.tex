\subsection*{1.8} $|T| \leq |S^T|$ if $|S| \geq 2$.

\begin{proof}
Assume that $|S| \geq 2$. This implies that there are two elements $a,b \in S$ with $a \neq b$. We can therefore construct, for each $t \in T$, a unique function $f_t(x) = a$ for $x = t$ and $f_t(x) = b$ otherwise. Since for any $t_1, t_2 \in T$ with $t_1 \neq t_2$, $f_{t_1} \neq f_{t_2}$, it follows that this construction is an injective mapping from $T$ onto $S^T$ and the conclusion follows.

\end{proof}
