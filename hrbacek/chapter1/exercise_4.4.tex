\subsection*{4.4} Let $A$ be a set. Show that the complement of $A$ does not exist, that is, there is no set $B$ such that $x \in B$ if and only if $x \notin A$.

\begin{proof}
Assume that the set $B$ with the property in the problem statement exists. Then, we can construct the set $X = A \cup B$. But $X$ would be the set of all sets, and therefore this is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
