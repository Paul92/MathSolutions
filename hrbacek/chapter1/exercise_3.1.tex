\subsection*{3.1}

Show that the set of all $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$ exists.

\begin{proof}
Let $A, B$ be some arbitrary sets, and define the proposition $P(x, A, B) = x \in A $ and $x \notin B$.

We can now apply the axiom schema of comprehension to define a set $S = \{x \in A | P(x, A, B)\} = \{x \in A | x \in A~and~x \notin B\}$. By the axiom, this set exists and is unique.

\end{proof}
