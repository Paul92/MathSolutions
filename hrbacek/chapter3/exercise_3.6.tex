\subsection*{3.6} If $X \subset N$, then there is a one to one (finite or infinite) sequence $f$ such that $ran~f = X$.

\begin{proof}
Let $a$ be the least element of $X$ and define $f: N \rightarrow N$ by $f(0) = a$ and $f(n+1)$ is the least element of $X - \{f(k) | 0 \leq k \leq n\}$ if it exists and $f(n+1)$ is undefined otherwise. 

From the previous exercise, $f$ is a finite sequence with range $A$. Moreover, by construction, it is increasing, and hence one-to-one.
\end{proof}
