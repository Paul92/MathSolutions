\subsection*{2.8} Prove that there is no function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f(n) > f(n+1)$.

\begin{proof}
Assume that there is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f(n) > f(n+1)$. Since $Ran(f) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, it has a minimum element. Let $f(n)$ be the minimum element of $Ran(f)$. Now consider $f(n+1)$. We have $f(n+1) < f(n)$. But this implies that $f(n+1)$ is the minimum element of $Ran(f)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
