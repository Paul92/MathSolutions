\subsection*{2.1} Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Prove that there is no $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n < k < n+1$.

\begin{proof}
Since for all $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $a < b$ if and only if $a \subset b$, it follows that $n < k < n+1$ is equivalent to $n \subset k \subset n+1 = S(n)$ and the conclusion follows from the previous exercise.
\end{proof}
