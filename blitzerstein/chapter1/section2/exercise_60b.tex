\begin{exercise}{60b}
    How many possible bootstrap samples are there for $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$, if the order does not matter (in the sense that it only matters how many times each $a_j$ was chosen, not the order in which they were chosen).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    This problem can be solved using the stars and bars technique. By the Bose-Einstein formula, there are ${2n-1 \choose n}$ samples.
\end{proof}
