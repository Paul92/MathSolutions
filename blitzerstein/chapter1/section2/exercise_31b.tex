\begin{exercise}{31b}
Define notation for the sample space of the problem, and use this to compute the
probabilities from (a) and show that they are the same.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    The sample space of the problem is the set of $r$ red balls and $g$ green balls.

    When extracting a ball, the probability that the first ball is green is $\frac{g}{r+g}$.

    After the extraction of the first ball, the sample space size is reduced by one. If the first ball was red, then
the probability that the second ball is green is $\frac{r}{r+g} \cdot \frac{g}{r+g-1}$. If the first ball was green, then the probability that the second ball is also green is $\frac{g}{r+g} \cdot \frac{g-1}{r+g-1}$, leading to a total probability that the second ball is green of

$$ \frac{r}{r+g} \cdot \frac{g}{r+g-1} + \frac{g}{r+g} \cdot \frac{g-1}{r+g-1} = \frac{rg+g^2-g}{(r+g)(r+g-1)} = \frac{g(r+g-1)}{(r+g)(r+g-1)} = \frac{g}{r+g}$$
\end{proof}
