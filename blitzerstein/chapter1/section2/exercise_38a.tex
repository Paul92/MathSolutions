\begin{exercise}{38a}
    There are n balls in a jar, labeled with the numbers $1,2\dots n$. A total of k balls are
drawn, one by one with replacement, to obtain a sequence of numbers.

 What is the probability that the sequence obtained is strictly increasing?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    There are $n^k$ possible sequences of k numbers. In order for a sequence to be strictly increasing, it must be sampled without replacement. Also, given a sample of $k$ numbers, there is exactly one strictly increasing ordering. Therefore, the number of strictly increasing sequences is the same as the number of samples without replacement, $n \choose k$. It follows that the probability of a strictly increasing sequence is $\frac{{n \choose k}}{n^k}$.
    
\end{proof}
