2. using a much smaller sample space, which focuses on Tyrion and Cersei.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    When seating at the table, Tyrion can choose any of the 12 seats and Cersei can choose any of the remaining 11 seats, resulting in $12 \cdot 11 = 132$ possibilities.

    But for each position of the Tyrion at the table, Cersei can only choose two places to be next to Tyrion, resulting in $12 \cdot 2$ possibilities. This leads to a probability of $\frac{12\cdot 2}{12 \cdot 11} = \frac{2}{11} \approx 0.1818$
\end{proof}
