\begin{exercise}{59b}
    The chocolate bars are fungible, and each child must receive at least one.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
    Since each child must receive a chocolate bar and the bars are fungible, the difference between various distributions of chocolate is made by how the remaining 5 bars are distributed, which can be done in $10^5$ ways.
\end{proof}
