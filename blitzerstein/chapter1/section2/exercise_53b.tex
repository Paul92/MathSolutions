\begin{exercise}{53b}
    How many possibilities are there if he is required to have at least one lowercase letter and at least one uppercase letter in his password?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Due to the symmetry between the lowercase and the uppercase letters, there are $36^8$ passwords with no uppercase letter. We can subtract these from the number of passwords with at least one lowercase letter, obtaining $62^8-2 \cdot 36^8$. But this means that we subtract twice the passwords that don't have neither an uppercase nor a lowercase letter, a total of $10^8$ of them (the number of passwords only with digits). Adding them back gives the final answer of $62^8-2 \cdot 36^8 + 10^8 = 212697985769984 \approx 2.12 \cdot 10^{14}$
\end{proof}
