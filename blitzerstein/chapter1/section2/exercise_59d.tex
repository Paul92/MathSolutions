\begin{exercise}{59d}
    The chocolate bars are not fungible, and each child must receive at least one.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We first make a queue of the children and let them choose one bar. The first child can choose one of the 15 bars, the second can choose one of the 14 remaining bars, and so on. There are $15 \cdot 14 \cdot \dots \cdot 5$ ways to distribute to each child one bar of chocolate, and $10^5$ ways of distributing the remaining five bars, giving a total count of $15 \cdot 14 \cdot \dots \cdot 5 \cdot 10^5$ ways of distributing the chocolate.
\end{proof}
