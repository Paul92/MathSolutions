\begin{exercise}{60a}
    Given $n \geq 2$ numbers $(a_1, \dots a_n)$ with no repetitions, a bootstrap sample is a sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ formed from the $a_j$'s by sampling with replacement with equal probabilities. Bootstrap sample arise in a widely used statistical method known as bootstrap. For example, if $n=2$ and $(a_1, a_2) = (3,1)$, then the possible bootstrap samples are $(3,3)$, $(3,1)$, $(1,3)$ and $(1,1)$.

    How many possible bootstrap samples are there for $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    A bootstrap sample chooses $n$ items with replacement and equal probability from a sequence of $n$ items. This means that in every slot there are $n$ possible items, hence there are $n^n$ possible bootstrap samples.
\end{proof}
