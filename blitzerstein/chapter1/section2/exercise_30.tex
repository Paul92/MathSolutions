\begin{exercise}{30}
Four cards are face down on a table. You are told that two are red and two are black, and
you need to guess which two are red and which two are black. You do this by pointing
to the two cards you’re guessing are red (and then implicitly you’re guessing that the
other two are black). Assume that all configurations are equally likely, and that you do
not have psychic powers. Find the probability that exactly j of your guesses are correct,
for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    There are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ possible ways of making my guess. Only one of these guesses matches the colors of all cards correctly, with a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$. There is also a single guess which gets all cards wrong, with a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$.

    Labelling correctly one card implies that at least another one will be chosen correctly. This means that there is no way to obtain only one or three correct guesses.

    As for the case with two correct guesses, one has to choose one red and one black card. This can be done in four ways, leading to a probability of $\frac{4}{6}$.
    
\end{proof}
