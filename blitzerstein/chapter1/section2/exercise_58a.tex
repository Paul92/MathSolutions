\begin{exercise}{58a}
    A widget inspector inspects 12 widgets and finds that exactly 3 are defective. Unfortunately, the widgets then get all mixed up and the inspector has to find the 3 defective widgets again by testing widgets one by one.

    Find the probability that the inspector will now have to test at least 9 widgets.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Assume that, before re-testing the parts, the inspector aligns them in a row, in one of the 12! possible permutations. He won't test 9 or more parts if he manages to find all the defective parts in the first 8 parts. We now try to count the number of permutations of the parts where the three faulty parts are in the first 8 positions. There are $8 \choose 3$ positions where the faulty parts can be placed, each placement with 3! permutations. The remaining 9 parts have 9! permutations. This leads to a total of ${8 \choose 3} \cdot 3! \cdot 9!$ permutations where the faulty parts are amongst the first 8 parts.
    This means that the probability that the inspector has to test at least 9 parts is:

    $$p = 1 - \frac{{8 \choose 3} \cdot 3! \cdot 9!}{12!} = \frac{41}{55} \approx 0.74545$$
\end{proof}
