\begin{exercise}{31c}
Suppose that there are 16 balls in total, and that the probability that the two balls
are the same color is the same as the probability that they are different colors. What
are r and g (list all possibilities)?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    For the first ball, the probability of choosing a red ball is $\frac{r}{16}$ while the probability of choosing a green ball is $\frac{g}{16}$.

    The probability of choosing two red balls is $\frac{r}{16} \cdot \frac{r-1}{15}$. The probability of choosing two green balls is $\frac{g}{16} \cdot \frac{g-1}{15}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing two balls of the same color is $\frac{r}{16} \cdot \frac{r-1}{15} + \frac{g}{16} \cdot \frac{g-1}{15} = \frac{r(r-1) + g(g-1)}{15 \cdot 16}$.

    The probability of choosing a red and a green ball is $\frac{r}{16} \cdot \frac{g}{15}$, while the probability of choosing a green and a red ball is $\frac{g}{16} \cdot \frac{r}{15}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing two balls of distinct colors is $\frac{r}{16} \cdot \frac{g}{15} + \frac{g}{16} \cdot \frac{r}{15} = \frac{2rg}{15 \cdot 16}$.

    We want the two above probabilities to be equal. This implies that $r(r-1) + g(g-1) = 2rg$ and hence $r^2 - r + g^2 - g = 2rg$. But $g = 16-r$ and hence 
    
    
    \begin{align*}
        r^2 - r + (16-r)^2 - 16 + r &= 2r(16-r) \\
        r^2 - r + 16^2 - 32r + r^2 - 16 + r &= 32r - 2r^2 \\
        4r^2-64r+16^2 &= 16 \\
        (2r-16)^2 &= 16 \\
        2r-16 &= \pm 4 \\
        r &\in \{6, 10\}
    \end{align*}

    It follows that $(r,g) \in \{(6,10), (10, 6)\}$.
\end{proof}
