\begin{exercise}{38b}
What is the probability that the sequence obtained is increasing? (Note: In this
book, “increasing” means “nondecreasing”.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Similar to as before, each random sample with replacement has a unique increasing ordering. Therefore, the number of increasing sequences corresponds to the number of samples with replacement. According to the Bose-Einsten result, there are ${{n+k-1} \choose {k}}$ such samples. This means that the probability of sampling an increasing sequence is $\frac{{{n+k-1} \choose {k}}}{n^k}$.
\end{proof}
