\begin{exercise}{59a}
    There are 15 chocolate bars and 10 children. In how many ways can the chocolate bars be distributed to the children, in each of the following scenarios?

    The chocolate bars are fungible (interchangeable)
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
This can be solved with the Bose-Einstein relation, giving ${15+10-1 \choose 15} = {25 \choose 15}$ different ways to distribute the chocolate.
\end{proof}
