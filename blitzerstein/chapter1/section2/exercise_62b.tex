\begin{exercise}{62b}
    Explain intuitively why it makes sense that $p($at least one birthday match$)$ is minimized when $p_j = \frac{1}{365}$ for all $j$ from 1 to 365, by considering simple and extreme cases.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    In order to minimize the probability of a birthday match, we need to maximize $e_k(p)$. If $p_j = \frac{1}{365}$ for all $j$ from 1 to 365, then $e_k(p) = {365 \choose k} \frac{1}{365^k}$.

    At the other extreme, if all people are guaranteed to be born in a single day, then $e_k(p)$ is 0.

    Besides these numerical examples, the intuition behind the reason why the probability of a birthday match is minimized when the birth probability is uniform is simply that having a specific day be more probable increases the chance that more people are born on that day, and implicitly the probability of a birthday match.
\end{proof}
