\begin{exercise}{35a}
A deck of cards is shuffled well. The cards are dealt one by one, until the first time an
Ace appears.

Find the probability that no kings, queens, or jacks appear before the first ace.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Note first that the first ace acts as a way of slicing the deck in a first and a second part. The problem then becomes equivalent to sampling a subset without replacement out of a set of 52-4=48 cards (because we can't select aces).

    We can sample zero up to 48 (inclusive) cards - this means that we have $\sum_{k=0}^{48} {48 \choose k} = 2^48$ ways of selecting the cards, and we can use any of the four aces to stop the selection, leading to a total of $4\cdot 2^{48} = 2^{50}$ hands.

    On the same line of thought, we can count the hands which don't have the kings, queens, or jacks by reducing the sampling set to $48-12 = 36$ cards. This gives a total of $4 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{36} {36 \choose k} = 2^{38}$.

    The probability is then $\frac{2^{38}}{2^{50}} = \frac{1}{2^{12}} = 0.000244140625$
\end{proof}
