\begin{exercise}{9b}
How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (210, 211), where each step consists of going
one unit up or one unit to the right, and the path has to go through (110, 111)?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    This problem can be split in two: we first have the number of paths from (0,0) to (110, 111), and then the number of paths from (110, 111) to (210, 211). In total, there are  $\frac{221!}{(10! \cdot 111!}+\frac{(100+100)!}{100! \cdot 100!}=\frac{221!}{110! \cdot 111!}+\frac{200!}{100! \cdot 100!}$.
\end{proof}
