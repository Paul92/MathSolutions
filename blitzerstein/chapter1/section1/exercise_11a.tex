\begin{exercise}{11a}
Let A and B be sets with $|A| = n$, $|B| = m$.

\vspace{1em}
How many functions are there from A to B (i.e., functions with domain A, assigning
an element of B to each element of A)?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We could count the number of functions from $A$ to $B$ by independently each of the elements from $A$ one element from $B$. There are $n$ elements in $A$, and each of them gets assigned one of the $m$ elements of $B$, so there are $m^n$ functions from $A$ to $B$.
\end{proof}
