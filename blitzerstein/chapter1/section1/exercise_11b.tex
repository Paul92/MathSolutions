\begin{exercise}{11b}
How many one-to-one functions are there from A to B (see Section A.2.1 of the
math appendix for information about one-to-one functions)?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    A one-to-one function cannot assign the same element of $B$ to different elements of $A$. This means that each function from $A$ to $B$ is a sample without replacement. There are $\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}$ such functions - note that we need to have $m \geq n$, otherwise there are no injective functions from $A$ to $B$.
\end{proof}
