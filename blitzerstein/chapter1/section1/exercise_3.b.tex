\begin{exercise}{3.b}
How many possibilities are there for Fredâ€™s schedule of dinners for that Monday
through Friday, if Fred is willing to eat at the same restaurant more than once, but is
not willing to eat at the same place twice in a row (or more).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We can follow the same line of thought as in the previous problem. In the first day, he can choose any of the ten restaurants. In the following days, he can choose any restaurant except the one he ate on the previous day, so there are 9 choices. This means that there are $10 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 65610$ possible schedules.
\end{proof}
