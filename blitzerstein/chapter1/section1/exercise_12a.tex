\begin{exercise}{12a}
Four players, named A, B, C, and D, are playing a card game. A standard, well-shuffled
deck of cards is dealt to the players (so each player receives a 13-card hand).

\vspace{1em}
How many possibilities are there for the hand that player A will get? (Within a
hand, the order in which cards were received doesnâ€™t matter.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    This is the number of ways we could choose 13 cards out of 52, i.e. ${52 \choose 13} = 635013559600$ different hands.
\end{proof}
