\begin{exercise}{5.c}
Count how many games in total are played, this time by directly thinking about it
without doing almost any calculation.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
        At the end of the tournament, there has to be a single winner. Each game eliminates one player, so there have to be $2^n-1$ games to be left with a single winner.
\end{proof}
